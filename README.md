# Process Flows Metadada with LLM 

## Problem Statement
Before designing a flow, the Salesforce administrator must know which flows are connected to the objects theyâ€™re working with, so they can avoid conflicting logic. Extracting Flow metadata and describing the flow is a time consuming activity for admins and devs.

## Goal
This script will list all the flow metadata from an org (type, related object, and a short description), retrieve the flows strucutre using SF MetadataAPI and use Ollama (local) to generate the descriptions based on the metadata.

## Instructions
### Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### .env
```
# Salesforce credentials 

SF_USERNAME=
SF_PASSWORD=
SF_TOKEN=
```

### Ollama
You need to install and initialize Ollama 
```

ollama run llama3.1:8b

```

### Run the application
```
python ./scripts/main.py
```

## Improvements (Out of scope for now)
- UX to allow users to interact with the application
- Ability to extend the functionality to validation rules and apex triggers/classes
- Connect this script to OpenAI, Gemini or Claude to getter better and real results

## Findings / Learnings
- It's not possible to extract managed package or standard flows metadata - Potential limitation for real application
- Script structure is still confusing. I will need to find a way to plan my code in advance and split the script in specific modules to have a better structure
- Stackoverflow and Reddit are the best source of troubleshooting and learning! AI can help with different examples.
